In thirs grade I was flipping through my music textbook and saw a page that had pictures of the harp through the centuries, from the Egyptian harp with as few as 5 strings to the modern double-action concert grand with 47 strings. I remember going home and declaring that I was going to play the harp, much to my parents amusement. After all, when a 9-year-old says something like that, how serious can it be.</description></item></channel></rss>
