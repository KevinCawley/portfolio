Python was the first coding language I ever learned. I started learning it 
in the Fall of 2020 in my Introduction to Computer Programming class. I learned
Python 3.0, and used Spyder to work with Python. Spyder had an Editor, Debugger, 
Variable Explorer, and Shell all in one. It was a very contained experience which 
made it easy for me. I found the Shell fun because I could test out code by writing 
it directly into the shell to see the results instead of having to write a program 
and then run it. 

I started learning Python in my first semester of college, which is when I also started
working with [TARDIS](https://tardis-sn.github.io/tardis/index.html). As TARDIS is written 
in Python, I had to learn Python fast so I could start contributing to the research. This 
led to CodeAcademy, which gave me the benefit of going over material twice and also learning 
more Python ahead of the class, even in a somewhat shallow depth. 

My college python class progressed somewhat slowly, as it is a course that teaches the basics
of programming and lays the foundation, which is very useful as I had never coded before. However, 
this pace allowed for a lot more depth and practice with all of the techniques and data structures 
of Python, which I think was invaluable. It led me to be a lot more familiar with 
Python that I would have been just doing CodeAcademy. 

My Python skill is proficient; I can write complex programs and classes to do tasks. The 
final project that I had in my class was to replicate a Pok√©mon battle, using data from a 
.csv sheet and creating classes and methods that would allow for the fight. It was a fun challenge 
that combined everything I had learned in Python. This introduction class
made me realize my enjoyment of coding and using code to solve problems.
