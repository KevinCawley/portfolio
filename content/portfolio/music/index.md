I got interested in the harp in music class. In thirs grade I was 
flipping through my music textbook and saw a page that had pictures 
of the harp through the centuries, from the Egyptian harp with as few 
as 5 strings to the modern double-action concert grand with 47 strings. 
I remember going home and declaring that I was going to play the harp, 
much to my parents amusement. After all, when a 9-year-old says something 
like that, how serious can it be. 

After a year of asking my parents realized that I was genuienly interested, 
and after a bit we went down to Chicago. Chicago had two harp makers at the 
the time, Lyon & Healy Harps and Venus Harps. We went to Lyon & Healy, as they 
had deals where you could rent a level harp but could return it for most of the 
price within a year to allow people to try out the harp. 

I still remember playing my first note. I was very scared and didn't want to 
break it, so I played it so quietly it was hard to hear. 

I have been playing the harp for over 11 years. 
This piece, The Moldau trans Hans Trneƒçek, is a piece that I have listened to 
for years. I love the orchestra version, and I would listen to it frequently. 
I got the music once for fun 2 years before I started learning it. I remember 
trying the first two measures and realizing that my what my teacher, Chen-Yu, 
said about it being a hard piece was correct. I put it away as I was not able 
to even get one page down and learned other things that were more appropriate 
to my skill level. After finishing the Hindemith Sonata in the Spring of 2020 
(my senior year), I asked for fun if I could start The Moldau and my teacher 
at the time, Janelle Lake, agreed. 

It's a wonder to be able to play a piece that I have listened to for 5 years 
and always thought would be out of my reach, but after pushing myself with the 
Hindemith Sonata I found that I was able to push through this piece. I can 
achieve high goals if I push myself, and I think that this piece is proof of that.
