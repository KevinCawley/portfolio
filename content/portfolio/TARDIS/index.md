TARDIS is an open-source code whose purpose is to create  
fast and accurate synthesis of supernovae spectra while 
only requiring a few input parameters. These parameters 
can be modified and turned on/off to allow TARDIS to be 
used for different applications. Different models can be 
created by changing the concentration of elements, selecting 
different physics approximations and measurements, and other 
features.
