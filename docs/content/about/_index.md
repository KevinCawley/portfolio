I am currently a freshman at Michigan State University studying Computer Engineering with 
a minor in Harp Performance. One of my other interests is Chinese; I love being able to speak and 
understand the language, there is something about being able to read and understand a concept in 
more than one way that I enjoy immensely. 

My current major is computer engineering. Over the past year, I have become a lot more interested and 
engaged with computers. It started with me building my computer in February 2020 after my laptop 
was unable to run games that I wanted to play. The research that I had to do for picking the parts of 
my computer got me more interested in computers in general, and  my first coding class in Python helped 
foster that interest in computers. I am hoping to be able to expand upon my knowledge of computers over 
the summer with an internship that focuses on using Numba for just-in-time compiling, as well as working 
out how to enable GPU processing for TARDIS, a program that examines supernova ejecta, to help speed 
up computation.

A little bit about the harp. I have been playing for over 10 years, starting when I was in 
elementary school. Playing the harp is something that I enjoy immensely. It's not only relaxing, 
but it can also be a challenge when I start new pieces and push myself to learn them. This constant
pushing has had satisfying results; in the last year and a half I have developed at an insane rate 
in terms of my music skills, learning how to play pieces that I have listened to for years but always 
thought were out of my reach, such as The Moldau trans. Hans Trneček, and Impromptu by Gabriel Fauré.
