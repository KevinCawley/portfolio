I am currently a Sophomore at Michigan State University studying Computer Engineering with 
a minor in Harp Performance and Chinese. I love being able to speak and understand the language, 
there is something about being able to read and understand a concept in more than one way that 
I enjoy immensely. 

My current major is computer engineering. Over the past two year, I have become a lot more interested and 
engaged with computers. It started with me building my computer in February 2020 after my laptop 
was unable to run games that I wanted to play. The research that I had to do for picking the parts of 
my computer got me more interested in computers in general, and  my coding classes in Python and C++ helped 
foster my interest in computers. Over the summer of 2021 I had an internship to help optimize TARDIS through
benchmarking and GPU acceleration, which greatly increased my interests in the computational aspect of computers.

I am hoping to be able to expand upon my knowledge of computers over 
the summer with an internship that focuses on using Numba for just-in-time compiling, as well as working 
out how to enable GPU processing for TARDIS, a program that examines supernova ejecta, to help speed 
up computation.

A little bit about the harp. I have been playing for over 10 years, starting when I was in 
elementary school. Playing the harp is something that I enjoy immensely. It's not only relaxing, 
but it can also be a challenge when I start new pieces and push myself to learn them. This constant
pushing has had satisfying results; in the last year and a half I have developed at an insane rate 
in terms of my music skills, learning how to play pieces that I have listened to for years but always 
thought were out of my reach, such as The Moldau trans. Hans Trneček, Impromptu by Gabriel Fauré, and
Il Trovatore by Angelo Bovio.

I won a National Gold Medal in Harp Level 2 from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2014, 
and the National Gold Medal in Harp Level 4 from the Royal Conservatory of Music in 2016. 
I won First Class Honors with Distinction Level 8 in Harp in 2019. -->
