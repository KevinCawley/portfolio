My first solo project was in documentation. I had been working on fixing up 
documentation errors that were present on GitHub issues, when I got ready to tackle 
two large issues: the creation of documentation and coding guidelines for TARDIS.  

This was a large step up in importance, as I would be setting guidelines for how 
all code past and future should be written. It would also make it so that 
documentation issues like the ones I had been working on for the past month 
wouldn't be repeated. It would also have an impact on everyone using TARDIS, so 
what I created had to be good and concise. 

This task was a lot different from my previous tasks. Instead 
of fixing well-defined issues, I had to make guidelines to try and prevent 
any other issues and answer questions as to how code should be written and 
formatted in the future. This task made me learn a lot more about code 
creation in general, as well as the syntax rules around coding in Python. The 
tool Black, which is a PEP8 compliant opinionated code formatter, was chosen 
to format the code automatically. Naming conventions and 
docstrings were also covered, with an example and explanation of each aspect of the 
conventions used. 

I started and finished this myself, but as this is such a large and important piece I 
also got introduced to a new mentor, Jaladh, who helped proofread and expand upon 
my documentation, adding guidelines for exception handling which I had never considered. 
The final piece of this was to create instructions for how to build documentation locally 
so that anyone working on TARDIS can test to see how pages will be built without having to 
do commits. This led to more exploration into reStructuredText and made 
checking and fixing documentation and files a lot easier. 

This was the first big project that I was given the lead on, and I am very 
confident in the results. I do very well with clear instructions and goals, so this 
project was outside of my comfort zone due to that and the importance of it. You can read 
the documentation guidelines that I wrote [here](https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/blob/master/docs/development/documentation_guidelines.rst#id1).
