My first introduction to TARDIS was due to my involvement in the 
Professorial Assistantship program at MSU, which allowed me as a 
freshman to start doing research. I was placed with TARDIS due to 
my interest in understanding how the world works and my enjoyment of math.

After I had finished my crash course of Python 2 (TARDIS is written 
in Python 3, but Python 2 was free) through CodeAcademy, I was given 
my first task. This task was meant to gauge my effectiveness in programming, 
so I was given a relatively simple task. I had to convert a program that 
was mostly written in Cython, which tries to speed up Python by using C 
conventions, to Numba, a just-in-time compiler. 

This program was originally written in Cython to help make it faster, 
but the decision was made to convert it to Numba so it would be even 
faster, as speed is very important with TARDIS. I was able to work my 
way through most of the conversion in a few days, but I got hung up 
due to my inexperience. One of the checks is to make sure that the results 
are the same with both processes. My code was correct, but at the time I 
lacked a good understanding of types, especially in regards to types 
that you get when you import modules. This slowed me down immensely, and it 
took a few weeks for me to realize and then work with these types to create 
a test that showed that my code gave the same result. After a few weeks, I was 
able to create a test that would show that the code would output the same results, 
and my changes were merged. This was my first contribution to TARDIS, and 
a big achievement for me as I, as a freshman with only a month or so of coding 
experience, was able to commit and have an impact on TARDIS, which is seeking 
to help expand knowledge of the universe. It was an extremely memorable 
moment, as even though it was a small commitment, I was able to contribute 
and help improve TARDIS. This helped me feel like I belonged and 
remove some of the Imposter Syndrome that I was experiencing being 
around all of the experts in TARDIS.
