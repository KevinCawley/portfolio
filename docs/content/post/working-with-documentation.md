As a result of my somewhat slow results and my basic knowledge of Python 
at the time, I was put onto the documentation for TARDIS. TARDIS documentation 
is very cohesive, but there were issues mostly regarding formatting and the 
style of documentation, specifically with regards to docstrings. There was 
old syntax present that would mess with the TARDIS documentation pages, so I 
read through all of the modules going around fixing the docstrings. This took 
a few tries to get a majority of the issues, but they were all cleared up. 

The next small project I got to work on was creating documentation that would 
automatically generate the names, authors, and links to papers that used TARDIS 
in research with my fellow freshman PA Isaac. This was a fun experiment into 
using modules and the pandas dataframe. This also led to research of how files 
and folders are organized, and the naming syntax so that files and folders are 
linked when the documentation is created. The folder that generates the list of
research papers that use tardis can be viewed [here](https://github.com/tardis-sn/tardis/tree/master/docs/research/research_done_using_TARDIS).
This was an important achievement to me, being able to write code with Isaac to 
help add a feature to TARDIS instead of just improving existing material was 
extremely rewarding, as well as fun to be able to put my newfound coding skills to use.
